bismillah ar-rahman ar-rahim saad wal alquran zizikri innaka...(surah 1 sad) 
so here's what this talk is about it's actually about the 38th surah of the Quran surah sad so that's called Saad okay it's a meccan surah 
it has 80 something I add and it's a very unique beautiful surah in the Quran and I'll tell you something that's been making me amazed by the Quran more recently over the last few maybe 
almost a year now I study different aspects of the Quran but one of the areas of the study of the Quran that has completely blown my mind is how the Quran is organized 
how the Quran is organized, it's absolutely fascinating and it's one of the areas of the study of the Quran that has gotten 
very little attention like some people 
have done work on it but a lot of people just didn't really give it much attention 
one of the pioneers in this subject is a scholar who passed away almost a century ago by the name of Hamiddudin Farahhi
brilliant absolutely brilliant scholar and 
he would actually even give spiritual reasons 
he would say things like what if the one who created your fingers and organized every bone in every joint 
why would he not organize his book? 
you know he would he would actually make a spiritual argument about the perfection of the organization of the Quran 
==== contoh struktur surah sad
right? so this session I want to share with you a structural overview kind of a theme.
some of the themes and the structure of surat 
== ust nouman coba nguji jamaah
what I forgot ? what's all I was? or what surah number? was that 83 very good what was 
it okay good you're paying attention was makki ? madani ?
I forgot let's Meccan yeah no it's Meccan, okay so so that's  surah sadd 
it begins and we're not going to go through the entire surah it's 80 so my  surah sadds and you know typically when I give a hug by it's about one ayah and then the thirty minutes are done so we're not going to do that but we're trying to try to capture as many lessons as we can that's my by the way that's 
my first agenda in this talk (try capture many lesson from surah sad)
my second agenda I hope we get time to do it is to actually go through a small episode from the life of dawood alehissallaam that's inside this surah and that's going to be important because actually my last session is going to be about his son so they might so that's going to be later on so we're going to 
try to cover some things about the father in this session and then get to the son in the next session right so that's that's the idea behind the two anyhow 
so Allah begins shaad well or any they think of shaad 
I swear by the Quran that possesses reminder 
the Quran that possesses reminder Allah swears by the Quran and you need to understand something about 
when Allah swears by something like when assam he swears by time what teenie was a tune he swears by the fig and the olive was shamsiel oh haha he swears by the Sun and well as it comes up and becomes brilliant so these oats in the Quran they have many many functions but one of the most amazing functions that they have is that they are actually evidence now 
I want you to remember this when Allah swears by something he makes whatever he swore by he makes it evidence 
he makes it evidence when do you need evidence when you have to prove something that's 
when you need evidence ?
you need evidence in court don't you you need evidence to you know to prove that you did this assignment nobody else did it evidence is used when you are being challenged something is being held against you and in order for you to be innocent you have to prove with your evidence similarly if you want to prove somebody's guilty you also need what evidence so in order to prove innocence or in order to prove guilt you need evidence in order to prove something as a fact you need evidence now Allah is saying that the evidence here in this surah is that the Quran possesses what reminder the Quran is full of reminder it has the power of reminder this is a less evidence but what is this evidence for what is he proving I mean now we have the proof but what is the thesis that he's proving what's remarkable in this surah and in some solos of the Quran is a lot never tells you what the thesis is to give you an example to get wrap your head around this he swears by time he says well Alan I swear by time so now time is evidence because he swore by time time is 
what evidence what is that he what is it that he's proving he's proving in that in Santa Fe hosin no doubt human beings are in los and what is the biggest proof that human beings are in Los what's the biggest evidence that human beings are in Los it's time because they're always losing time there's nothing you're there's never any opportunity for you or me to gain a single second we're always going to be what losing it 
so the biggest proof of loss is time itself you understand that one so now here he says the Quran is full of reminder I swear by the Quran that it's full of reminder in other words 
I'm making the Quran that's full of reminder evidence 
evidence to the fact that even though it is full of reminder and it's in between the lines even 
the quran is full of that reminder you just don't take advantage and remember the Quran being full of reminder is actually an evidence against a forgetful because the one who refuses to remember is guilty and how are they guilty you need proof against them what's the proof against them that the Quran is full of reminder 
this Quran will testify on Judgment Day against the one who didn't do the cut from it it'll testify and say why didn't you remember well 
I didn't know if the Quran was worthy of mentioning every day 
I didn't know if I should be thinking about it every day I didn't know if I should be reciting and and pondering it every day what are you talking about why didn't you think these things it is full of the potential of reminder 
reminder means something you keep going back to over and over again 
something that doesn't just go away once and it possesses it every single time which suggests not only do you get reminded once you have to be reminded continually throughout your life and so when you and I in that relationship with the Quran the beginning ayat of surah Saad are the ultimate evidence against scary stuff then what's even more remarkable in this surah as you go through the surah one of the things you may learn from me maybe some other other researchers and Quran studies is that every surah it has some words that keep coming up some words in a solar keep coming up I like to call them anchors that's my own terminology I may have made that up I like to call them anchors inside a sewer okay and the anchor inside the surah no surprise is actually thicker multiple times in this surah allah will talk about so you can remember this is a reminder live welcome to the karun so you can make an effort to remember you know in Hawaii ethic in hey la vie Cara it's a powerful reminder what grab Donna remember our slave reminder reminder reminder until the very end of the surah at the very last ayah of the surah allah azzawajal says Allahu Allah the Quran is nothing but reminder for all nations you know in Hawaii a cruel Delilah meanwhile at Ala Moana baahubali he and is nothing but reminder so it began with reminder and it actually ends with reminder as well that's the first thing I wanted to get across to you guys now I want to share the second anchor with you because these two are the most powerful things if you understand them you'll understand the theme of this so it's really cool the first anchor is what remind them to remember Allah to make an effort to remember him okay the second anchor is actually in the next ayah valid ladina Cafaro is that in worship are those who disbelieved are lost and they are immersed inside it is done now is that as a complicated word to translate is that you can say can translate into two things at the same time if you use one word in English is not enough so we're going to use two words for the word Reesa Reesa will be on the one hand dignity dignity and the other hand it will also be Authority dignity and authority let's understand those words before we move on sometimes people have a lot of dignity like a teacher has dignity an old man has dignity ashay has dignity right but these these people sometimes they have dignity but they don't have what they don't have authority there is a very dignified old man but he's a retired professor or something he doesn't have authority over anything anymore right so you possess his dignity but no authority sometimes you have people that have a lot of authority and too often they don't have anyone then I have any dignity right so they may possess Authority but they don't possess dignity when somebody has a son then what do they have dignity and authority now Allah says that disbelievers instead of taking advantage of Allah's reminder they are lost in their own sense of dignity and authority they think that there are two noble they don't need nobility from anywhere else they're already super respectable their status in society what they think of themselves what they want others to think of them is enough for them and on top of that why would they turn to the Quran as an authority because they think of themselves already as the ultimate authority why they need to turn the Quran so Allah says this idea of you know self-absorbed dignity and authority this is what's keeping people from taking advantage of the Quran as a reminder I don't need it you know it's a very telling analysis from the Quran that there are people 
when they read the Quran it embarrasses them it 
highlights what they're not doing and highlights some of their flaws and that's embarrassing and it takes away your sense of dignity so they walk away from it they don't want to deal with it sometimes these reciting the Quran and you wanted to do things 
this way but unless book wants you to do things that way and 
it challenges your right to do things the way you wanted it challenges your authority these people don't want to let go of their authority they don't want to let go that's why they don't want to remember the Quran it's annoying to them every time they hear it it reminds them of how the other direction they're going in so Allah says balilazi na kafaru fear is that it was Chicago now she talked also by the way a schism meaning they're cracked away they're stubborn they're stuck in the way they are they're not gonna budge now that I've given you this introduction the Surat the two major anchors of the surah are what now reminder and as right as I is easy because its eyes made up of two words one of those two words again dignity and authority right those are the two words okay you'll find as that keeps coming up and a Las name Allah will say what do you think you have to suffer that's why in the first passage Allah will mention one of his names and it's going to be a disease and Wahab is going to mention his own name a disease what do you think you get dignity and authority from the one who possesses all dignity and all authority is Allah Aziz Allah Himself that's Allah Himself now that I've given you these two anchors now the fun begins this is where you have to remember stuff but before I ask you to remember stuff let me see what you remember already what's little are we studying slow number it begins with an oath what's the purpose of an oath of an oath is supposed to be oh not bad evidence three sisters know the answer thank you people in the back I'm hope you're having a good nap this morning okay a little too much nasi lemak this morning what's going on okay so now this and by the way two anchors what are the two anchors reminder and and eisah and they're going to keep playing a role throughout the salah now we get to the fun part this surah is broken up into six parts these eighty semi-auto cut up into six parts and i will give you six words to remember each part okay I'll give you six words to remember each part you don't have to remember sentences just six words in that order here are those words first word Quraysh first word is polish second word is nations nation hos the first word second word good third word prophets okay I'm going to ask you one let's wake up and do that again one two three great for heaven for is what 
heaven you know 
Jannah take a guess what five is aa good guess hell let's start over one two three four five who's got it one two three four heaven five okay last ones weird last one is say just the words say say how many parts in the surah six parts six parts now I want you to remember these six parts and in order for you to remember you're going to have to repeat them one more time to me no no no no no no you got not synchronized I will I will organize you number one good phase two agents three prophets for heaven five and six let me walk you through this the first section of the surah is made up of ayat which Allah describes how stubborn the Quraysh are they are lost in is that and chicag remember that these are the this is a commentary on the Quraysh and they cannot understand why they should accept the Quran they call the prophets of Allah who are they've said I'm a magician a liar how could he take all of our gods and turn them into one garage a daud-daud-da in Haleiwa no job is such a weird thing that he's saying they start criticizing the prophets of the lager Salem when Telecom in Omaha woman whom I named she was widowed Anna auntie hattie : and then they say you know what not only do we not believe 
== aggresive kafir quraish
let's become more aggressive they march forward and they tell people march ahead become aggressive you know when you reject something and say I don't want to accept it you're defending yourself against it but they don't just want to be on the defense they want to be on the offense against Islam 
so they are asking their people to get fired up against the Muslims and M shoe and then aggressively protect your gods I only have you can commit yourselves to your gods they may give sermons about how awesome each Idol they want to fire people up about staying committed to their that's what they do they give not they're not just giving whole bus about how bad Islam is now they're going to give talks about how awesome their kids you know on the negative in the heart of a shake when you are  surah sadd then they're going to incite people and say this is exactly what is wanted of you if you want to be a loyal citizen of courage this is what you should be doing this is the first section of this surah and they'll say first of all they incite people to want to commit themselves to shake and then they'll criticize the prophet and the Quran and they say massimino bajada fill me little akhira in how they locked it out we never heard anything like this before what is this all made up if no other nation before you know our previous ancestry never brought anything like this up this is also weird this Quran business that he talks about this is all completely created by him it's just a creative exercise of this man who claims to be a prophet they go on the attack against the prophets I saw them Oh Angela and I hit the krugen by Nina or he is gonna get okay fine maybe there is a thicker what a thicker mean again see the anchor coming back you know he said they said oh this reminder comes to him well it is there no one else more qualified we have a few more wealthy millionaires we have people with a lot more political status if they were already influential why would it come to an orphan nobody listens to orphans anyway you know which it should have come to somebody more politically influential socially influential somebody who has business and dignity by the way this is the idea of ensign ship up all over again because we have is that we have Authority dignity respect that's why if there was going to be a profit it should have been us why him why even him the entire passage is dedicated to what kinds of things these people say to reject a song so the entire first passage is about the commitment of quotation got it that's one what's too ah Nations Allah says you're not the first ones to be stubborn I mean you're very committed and critical of what the Prophet is saying but I've seen this before there were many people many nations more powerful than you that came and did the same thing and they were taken care of so now the Quraysh is being compared to what previous nations Casablanca mu nu hain wad warfare Alvin or Cohen or you know warfare I won't run Oh T surah sadd Watson would welcome loot you recognize these names Allah is making reference to the Prophet nations after nations that were what happened to those nations they were destroyed Koresh is going down the same path that so many other nations have gone down why aren't they learning their lesson from history how are they so obnoxious they say we've never heard of anything like this you haven't heard of these nations in the first passage I said we never heard anything like this now listen what do you mean you haven't heard anything like this haven't you heard enough about these previous nations that were destroyed and then no the only thing all of those nations have had in common in : alack at the Barbizon fucka icon every last one of them all they did was deny call the prophets a liar call the messengers liars and that's why they deserved vengeance they deserved my vengeance Allah says and my retribution they ended up in punishment not it took nothing but one giant explosion and they were done with now this passage is immediately followed by a commentary about what there's one was perish - was Nations there was a three very good but the way these prophets come up is amazing Allah turns his attention to the Messenger of Allah so the long haul the use of them and he says look correlation really stubborn that's what established in section 1 1 and Quraysh are doing exactly the same thing that who did previously shion's which is established in Section 2 at this point the Prophet is going to be depressed well if they're going to do the same thing that previous nations did what's the point of preaching to them they're hopeless I won't I won't get anywhere with them what am I supposed to do when people are when profits are charged with an impossible task they need inspiration our Prophet himself sallallaahu I think set up also needs to look up to people that came before him and take inspiration from them so Allah turns his attention to his messenger salallahu alayhi wasalam so beautifully and he says to him wealth corp you make mention of our slave you know what's been either maya Kunlun what could I've done a delude than the ad in the whole world so beautiful you know just be patient over whatever they you need to be patient over whatever they say don't let that get to you and you what you should do is you keep remembering by the way remembering is an anchor from where Quran possesses reminder now we're learning Quran doesn't just have reminder of allah quran has reminder of role models Quran has reminder of history Quran has reminder of legacies inspiration it's not just one kind of reminder it's different kinds of reminder so he says why don't you make rep mention of our slave I've got a doubt why don't you remember that one in particular that would I'm interested in this now you know why because now every prophet has dignity you know that right every prophet has what but not every prophet enjoying what authority there were prophets that nobody listened to they had no authority the first example Allah gives of a messenger is actually a prophet who enjoyed dignity and authority and used it in the right way see the Quraysh used their dignity and authority to reject the truth but the messenger a DiSanto Salam is dignified and even though right now in Makkah because this is a mocking surah he's not in control so he doesn't have a lot of authority don't worry I'm giving you the inspirational story of the ODE who possessed great mine valeted and letting you know that because I'm giving you him as a role model you're going to have power pretty soon take lesson from him take him as inspiration so da da da Sam is mentioned now we've entered the third section what is that section called prophets I'm going to skip quickly to give you the overview but Allah talks about doubt alehissalaam who was by the way one of the only prophets in the Quran or there's only one more we'll get to him at the end who's called the Khalifa he's called a Khalifa he's left he's going to leave a legacy behind on the earth he's going to be given great authority on the earth and this is something given to doubt alehissalaam and now the first inspiration to the prophet's life salam in this surah is downtown in salaam to let him know the dignity and authority in the form of Khilafah will be coming to who the messenger sallallahu wasallam this is not just an accident that this this messenger is being mentioned but by the way even if the profit gets Authority even if the profits lie Selim is inspired and he gets victory over the Quraysh that doesn't mean that the goodness of Islam will last because you know when prophets died what happened soon after you know the history right when prophets die what happens soon after she comes back nations deteriorate doesn't it so Allah gives him not only the story of doubt he says he was a doubt was able to carry his legacy forward with his son so they mom the next prophet mentioned is so named on and through it it's actually an embedded listen to the prophets life Salaam that what you will be given will be passed down just like that would was able to pass it down to who Suleiman it may not be in the form of a son but you will be granted much better than sons you'll be granted an entire Ummah that will carry your legacy and we're actually part of that we're part of the inheritance of the prophet salallahu alayhi wasalam you know what big shoes to fill so now the story of the Suleiman had a Salaam which is given a lot of attention in the surah it's actually far more detail than other stories and then at the end of it as we get through the story of Suleiman alehissalaam we're still in the section what's what's the section called prophets and in Childline my last session I'll share with you that is a unique prophet mentioned right after Suleiman Allah talks about Ayub are you anybody know what happened with a you but was this the unique challenge of a you body Salaam sickness right his sickness which is going to be interesting to study why is there a prophet that was tested with sickness mentioned immediately after Dawood and Suleiman which are the exact opposite power ability capability and now a prophet was not even in control of his own body he doesn't even have charge over his own physical be right so there's this contrast that's mentioned immediately the legacy of Ayub alehissalaam very briefly and after the you abide in his salaam allah says and by the way you should remember ibraheem is happy our cool wooden ad what absurd I'm not going to translate those names ibraheem is hak Jakub and then he mentions a little bit further ismael and yes our lists of prophets you don't have inspiration to take from one you have inspirations to take from many many many many many this is a summary of section 1 section 3 ok let's go back over section 1 all right bow section 2 nations bow section 3 why are the prophets being talked about do you remember because there the mention of prophets is there to inspire who the messenger Alisa toasted on those prophets are a an inspiration to our messenger sallallaahu isin got it this is going to be very important later on now we're done with three sections I forgot what the fourth section was of such bad memory huh Oh for heaven's sake it's okay so the next section is heaven Allah says harder the Quran were in hell in Medina la posta mohab Jannetty Adnan Moffat Aden l'homme Willa Bob this is a reminder hit the section on 
Jannah begins this is a reminder oh I'm reminded by reminder that the Quran is full of what reminder the anchor returns and then he says people of taqwa meaning these prophets that were described and all those who followed him they're going to have the best place to go back to they're going to have gardens of Eden where the doors are being held wide open Moffatt Elohim will ABAB on a side note I will tell you something about the gates of heaven and the gates of hell it's not part of the surah that's another study it's a study of when Suda's are compared to each other when this was compared to the next solo you find something you find that the gates of Jahannam are closed gates of hell or what closed and when somebody is dragged to hell then when they get to the gate then it's opened and they're letting but when the gates of heaven are described in this surah allah says Moffat that and they have been forcefully held wide open waiting for them already the gates of Jenelle Roman that's the mercy of Allah subhanAllah that's just on a side note about the beauty of how Allah describes Jannah as opposed to and his mercy as opposed to the Hellfire anyway so this Jannah is described they're going to be chillin on couches they're going to be calling for whatever kind of fruits they want you had in kathira sake huh by the way is a fruit that when you chew into it it makes you smile like a mangosteen and not a durian right wash up and they get all kinds of drinks yeah well it doesn't cost a lot of thought of fat Rob they're gonna have beautiful spouses that don't make you don't even make eye contact they're so shy to look at them and there's this this is subscribe don't get sisters I know relax okay this is what you've been promised on the day of accounting and this is a kind of provision nyla who in the fat it's never gonna run out this is the description of what now heaven okay now we've done a review of how many sections four sections how many sections are left what what are the two sections left okay okay okay now we're going to talk a little bit about Hell this hatha were in a little little heinous Rama Rama AB jehan de Mayo Sloan aha fab excel me hard hard of a yahoo honeymoon lhasa what they're going to taste what kind of horrible drinks they're going to be given and then you know there's going to be different forms of punishment thrown on onto them and then allah will say interestingly there's a unique description of hell in the surah he says hello gentlemen malcolm llama huh Bambi him in insulting our global anthem la marhaban become and took Adam - moo-hoo Lana from its anchor our allah describes that people are in heaven hell and there's another group that's being thrown on top of them and the people inside the prison of hell are saying there's no space what are you doing we don't want these people here and by the way you don't want other people because people are fuel for hell which means the more you feed a fire the more enraging it gets so they know when people are coming in the fire is going to get what it's going to get hotter we don't want more fuel don't throw more wood in here they're not welcome here there's no space for them haben doesn't just mean welcome like we say yah marhaban right but marhaban also means on raha bin space there's no space for them here and those guys say well you were here first so excuse me you know you're you were thrown in first-year worse people than us and so they get thrown in and they're talking they're talking trash to each other you know and who Madonna ha ha was it who aadhavan their front feet nah they say whoever came before us whoever had reserved seat in hell before we got here yeah la give him double punishment and they start hating on each other even in Hellfire and then Allah says you know that they're there in hell and they're hating on each other and they forget there's some other people they used to hate in dunya who did the disbelievers hate in dunya believers they say mother what's wrong hey there's something wrong here neroli Leonardo could not diminish a lot we don't see the people we used to count among the evil ones who did the disbelieving nations consider evil you know who they considered evil prophets they considered them the big troublemakers in their nations these are the people that are destroying your carrot age your culture they're coming and telling you your ancestors were wrong and you shouldn't be doing this or that or the other who are these people they're the evil of society and now these guys are in hell they're saying where are those bad guys you know the ones we used to consider bad a Tejada home so Koreans a Korean we used to take them as a joke remember I'm Zakaat animal ops or is it because it's so dark in hell we can't see them that's what they're saying and by the way this is another kind of cool clue the people in hell are having a conversation and who do they miss the the prophets and where the prophets and have it in the previous surah there are people in heaven talking and saying hey my best friend is in here where is he at and you find out he's in hell so the contrast picture is given in the previous surah this surah ties itself to the next one and to the previous one beautifully anyhow this section was a small glimpse of what's going on where what's going on in Hellfire Allah protect us all from the Hellfire what's that last section called Godse I call it say because in this final section of the surah allah does something very unique he tells the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam well now that I've told you that chorus are stubborn and I've told you they're going down the same path as those who came before and I've already told you that you should take inspiration from the previous prophets who are going to be destined to go into heaven and those who disbelieve in them are going to end up in hell well here's what you need to do now now that I've given you this sermon here's what you need to put into practice why don't you go back to that nation and go talk to them say this to them talk with your people talk to who by the way talk to Koresh good say in namah animal Dylan I'm just here to warn I'm my only job is to warn to be a Warner well mom in allahu allah allahu allah who kaha there's nobody to worship or obey in any way shape or form except Allah the only one the dominant one the master of the skies and the earth al Aziz the ultimate authority that is to be respected as an anchor from where he is that in right Allah fob the one who continually forgives cool who I know about when al them tell them it is a huge bit of news that's coming heaven in hell are not small things destruction of nations are not small things this is a huge bit of news that I'm giving you Anton who morally don't listen to this carefully this is an anchor you'll tell me what this is an anchor for you are ignoring it you are ignoring it exactly when the reminder is an anchor then not remembering is what ignoring you're not remembering you're ignoring and so ignoring is also part of that anchor it's not up to me to discuss you know what arguments are happening among the Angels even the angels are confused about what's going to happen other people of the earth which is another interesting story I'll tell you about that later if we get time so the prophets life Sodom is given this tell them this tell them this tell them this but all of a sudden something amazing happens Allah says no more tell them calculation you're only a prophet you're there to give a message I've been given the instructor I've only been given inspiration and I'm not just someone to give you clear warning a all of a sudden in the middle of it all in color Abu Khalil manicotti a new Harlequin Bashara main theme for it us away - who one of us to feed him a roofie hikaru Lihue Saji dean when a when Allah said when we said to the Angels when your master said to the Angels I'm creating a human being may you know skin based creature that is made of dirt when I more of him and I fashioned him and I balanced him and I blow into him from my own roof then fall into sajda before him then all of the angels made such that before him except Iblees he was from those who rejected wait that's not that's a different story but where's that sectional style you said the section is called what say there should have been another section called story of Adam no no I disagree with you keep listening it believes said what he said - he believes oh he said oh at least what what prevented you from doing such that you created me from fire you created right now you know the story already you don't you this entire passage seems like it came out of nowhere and by the way we already had a section called what prophets and other matter Islam is a well you could have just fit it over there why is it over here and then when this passage is done by the way Cohen say I'm not asking you for any compensation meaning this section began with say this this this this this in the middle what came the story of Adam and at the end of it again say I'm not asking you for compensation I'm not forcing this on myself I'm not making this stuff up this is just a reminder Oh anchor for all nations and all peoples what is this doing here 
in order to understand what's happening here now we're going to put everything together then you'll understand what's happening at the end the first section was foolish you remember this and Croatia extremely stubborn do you remember that at the end of all that inspiration and insight the Prophet is told to go back and deal with who Koresh and when he deals with Cora she's supposed to tell them his only job is there to warn did previous prophets have the same responsibilities yes except our prophet is different our prophet is different because what he has to do he has to do is directly related to what happened with adam alayhis-salam nice and Allah if least challenged Allah saying he will misguide all of humanity and the final answer from Allah that he will not be able to misguide that he will Allah will offer guidance that will last until the day of judgment the final weapon against the attacks of Iblis is what is given to the prophet muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam not just for courage but for who all of humanity prophet remember when you're talking to courage you're not just dealing with courage you're and you actually have the fate of all of humanity for the until the day of judgement in your hands so I need to remind you that you are now going to finish what was started with adam alayhis-salam that's why it's in the middle so before you even finish talking to croatia understand you're not just dealing with some village in the desert you're dealing with the fate of the entire planet all of humanity you understand why that's in the heart of it subhanAllah now how many sections were there I know you're tired I know you're tired of it it's ok this one's going to be different what was the first section check this out the first section was polish what is this sixth section say to who arrange the first section and the last section complete each other don't they it is actually this the last section that is responding in its entirety to the demands placed in the first section if they are so stubborn how do you deal with them you deal with them with the lessons you've learned in the last section so section 1 and section 6 are directly tied to each other ok what section 2 Nations previous lesions that were what what happened to them ok what is the fifth section ok so you have the past of disbelieving Nations in section two and then you have the future of disbelieving Nations in our two and five related to each other so the first one in the last one are tied to each other and the second one and the second last one are tied to each other and by the way when in the second section is allah talked about one nation or many nations remember he talked about many nations and when he described hell what did he describe one group will be there another will come and say hey guys we're here too and another one will come and another one will come in other words it perfectly corresponds to what was described in section 2 because nation after nation historically disbelieved and now those nations after nations are being piled into hell subhanAllah the third section is one which is the history of good people which should conclude the section three should be tied to what section I'm running out of sections because I already tied one to six and already tied two to five so I should tie three to one and how do you see any connection between three and four I don't seem to see it I don't see it's not obvious to me what is it prophets heaven how cool is that guys the entire surah is a perfect ematic symmetry everything ties together the stars we stuff see did you read this from i didn't read this in it to see I made it up I just had you know I I study structure of SOLAS in the Quran that's what I do that's what I'm amazed by and then I study each passage has its own you know how there's a symmetry here you see the symmetry guys do you see the symmetry or now you see it right each passage has its own symmetry we won't get into that now but each section has a symmetry of its own has a structure of its own which is Ya Allah how do you do that that's what I'm left with when I study this stuff so the Quran is full of and possesses what what do you remember reminder now the thing is there are things that are said about the prophets especially dowload and so they man I'm a him a ceramic among others they're not the prophets that were introduced to us only in Islam given in the Quran these prophets were told we were talked about in the Bible they were talked about in the Old Testament these are prophets of the Israelites right but the things that are said about these prophets in their books are not worth remembering as a matter of fact they're better forgotten why because terrible terrible things are said about these wonderful problems one of the jobs of the Quran is actually to restore the dignity of biblical prophets the Bible speaks of them in very bad ways unfortunately after the alteration made by human beings and the Quran comes and restores their dignity and one of the this last piece is not connected to the structure of the surah is just about that just restoring the dignity of daud-daud-da said I'm from the Bible's perspective let me tell you something about him first they call him Daud you guys know that okay they call him Daud and when he became King once he became king he was actually very obsessed with his power according to them and 
he wanted to marry 99 wives and he had 99 wives according to that not according to us and he said I need a hundredth one and so he sees this woman in a balcony from he looks out of his castle he sees this lady in a balcony says moon number 100 except she's married and she's married to one of the generals that is in his army so he commands that general to go into war where he knows he's going to get killed and so he sends him there gets killed and he marries the woman and that's how he gets his hundredth wife this is the biblical version keep this version this is not true at all not true at all keep this in mind as we read this passage okay now well he'll attack another awesome if the saguaro mihrab I will translate without explanation first did the news of the argumentative group come to you did anybody ever tell you about the argumentative group that scaled the giant wall and entered the prayer corners of Dawud mihrab is that where you pray so you have you know this castle is got a giant outside wall and these this group the whole group scaled the entire wall jumped over and entered into this place where he's supposed to privately pray his own mihrab if da da da da would when they came in and entered into Dowell's private space for fuzzy I mean home and he was terrified of them to the point where he was about to lose his mind fuzzer is actually used when you're so afraid you can't think straight anymore so he was scared out of his mind when he saw them Khalu da da ha they said no don't be scared we're not here to kill you I mean usually when people scale a castle wall and we'll break into a you know Kings private quarters and look very aggressive than you would think they're there to kill him they said no no no relax we're not here to kill you we made all this effort because we wanted to discuss an issue with you we just had a question let's tab you know so they jump in to ask a question and what's the question Hasani Bahuguna Annabelle there are two groups that are arguing one has done wrong against the other combined Annabelle Huck why don't you make a fair decision among us you are the ruler after all why don't you make a fair decision just decision well I touched it and don't be biased and don't use falsehood don't be inclined towards the wrong side Medina Ellis is a latina Allah Sawa is salat and guide us to the most even path to tell us what to do whatever verdict you give we're gonna follow it in na hava okay then one of them speaks and says this is my brother know who discern what this ona Naja he's got 99 sheep my brother owns how many 99 sheep does that remind you of anything from the Bible story well II knocked on wahida and I only have one sheep Allah axel Neha so he said why don't you give me custody of your sheep well as any filthy table and he uses his dignity and authority and imposes it on me when he talks to me he intimidates me with his dignity and his authority wait is that an anchor dignity Authority from where from the very beginning remember it comes up again anyway so he speaks to me intimidates me when he talks to me he says give me that one sheep what are you going to do with it I have 99 
I could use 100 you know collar locket voila maka Basu an energetic ideology he so that was Ali some said he's done wrong to you by asking you to add your one sheep to his he shouldn't have done that why indica theorem in ilaha illa Allah baba Hamada Bob a lot of partners who mix with each other and a lot of family members who mix with each other a lot of people that are close to each other they end up doing a lot of wrong to each other very profound statement people who do a lot of wrong to you are very close to you a very deep statement is not just business partners ha'la'tha is this anybody who mixes in this in this case brothers are doing horrible wrong to each other right so he says a lot of times people that are close to each other and mingle with each other they do the most wrong to each other illa allatheena amanu aminu sorry Hardwick Khalil Ouma home except those who believe and do good deeds and very few those are meaning it's very hard to do good deeds with people that are close to you very few people are able to do that you can give sadaqa to some guy on the street and go but your cousin - ogede it's much harder you know Anita mom well done that I would and then that would realize now check this out so they he gave this verdict well done that out realize on a Salaam it came to the realization and now and Omar Fatah now we were only testing him because these people poof they disappeared they just disappeared and he's like what just happened and he realized Allah was testing him for falafel or Abajo then he asked him was forgiveness for karma rakia and Watanabe fell in Telugu and he you know he repented now from this some have interpreted or must be the biblical story of the 99 wives and he realized I shouldn't have been going after 100 because that 99 sheep must have been about my ninety-nine wives you see what I'm saying and I use my authority to get number 100 but actually the answers in the Quran itself it's so beautiful it's 

so beautiful let's go back and understand daud Salam is in the prayer quarters in his neck Robb this group that came came upon him the saguaro the suborder comes from the word surah so that means a gigantic wall a wall that is impossible to scale actually the purpose of a surah is so it cannot be scaled these are the outer walls of a fort or a city so the fact that they climbed like 50 feet to get into his castle and there's a group of them is extremely shocking so he's off his feet Hafiz II I'm in home so much so and his doubt are they Sam he's killed Goliath before right he's killed Janet before he's been on the battlefield it's not like he's a scared human being but you know there are times where you get startled he's not expecting that in the in his in his castle so they break into him and then they show up there and then they we have a case and the case is I this is my brother he has how many sheep remember so the guy who's talking has how many sheep and by the way dadada he sallam used to be a very poor shepherd that I used to be what a very poor shepherd before he became an authority you know that's how he ended up killing John Luke because he was a shepherd and he used to you know use a slingshot to kill the wolf and things like that so who does that I shall relate with you think the guy who has one or the guy who has 99 and so immediately he says I only have one and he's using his authority to take my one sheep and he's a judge now Ali Salim is a judge and he says that's wrong they shouldn't do that anybody who has authority just takes authority and by the way that's an amazing sentiment to have from a king 
because kings and authorities usually favor the wealthy because they will need the favours from the wealthy later right for a king to favor the poor is a noble quality but the problem here is because he's a judge he's supposed to listen to both sides whether or not you agree with the guy with 99 or not he never defended himself did 
he the guy would 99 she never defended himself simply the guy would one sheep spoke doubt either his Salam was already rattled shaken up and 
he immediately gave the verdict that he shouldn't be doing that because a lot of times they wronged each other and 
they disappeared and Valerie Sam realized that in my rush to judgment 
I didn't hear what both sides and that's not right 
he also realized that when a judge is terrified overwhelmed with any emotion they shouldn't be sitting in the judges chair 
it's very profound he's the judge over his nation he's the ruler but a ruler needs to be emotionally stable to be able to pass judgments 
if he's shocked was he shocked in the beginning of the story 
if a judge is shocked terrified scared can he think straight 
is it possible he may rush to judgment or make an incorrect judgment is possible 
if for example a guy went through a divorce and he's a divorce court judge those ladies don't have a chance in his courtroom 
because he's going to see his you see what I'm saying if they have about if they have baggage they're not going to be able to pass judgment so he realizes there's baggage here so he immediately recognizes his fault and turns to Allah and repents and that's why Allah says so we forgave him that we forgave that meaning this small you know for a moment he forgot what he's supposed to do 
I think it can go away when you are in shock but immediately as soon as you come back to your sentence sense it senses Vicker comes back Russell sai-san is being taught there are moments where you will be overwhelmed 
but as soon as that overwhelming feeling is gone you have to remember your master immediately this is actually an inspiration of Vicker that da Dada son is given I wanted to share this with you because if you don't know the Collins narrative it's like you have this twisted biblical version that takes away so much dignity from these amazing prophets okay so those were my two item agenda is in child allah tala for this talk with you one was to share with you the beautiful organization of surah Saad and the other was to share with you just something about the dignity of the other son and what an amazing judge he was supposed to be what I'm really excited about though is the last session which is about 
Suleiman adding salaam and this really unique on there's no doubt like it in the Quran well lion are they there's no Darla's it's so unique and it's it's very difficult to understand I struggled with it a lot this dog that's one of the reasons I said this amazed by the Quran I'm going to do the dog sort of myself because 
I didn't understand it so I forced myself to study it and keep asking questions and by bothering scholars all over the world so that I could share some stuff with you 
and I really do think what I found was pretty amazing so inshallah with T surah sadd I have a good day I hope you enjoyed your nap I'm very happy for you hamdulillah as I leave you might as well bother you one last time how many sections in this surah what are the 
what is what sections are related to each other? 
one in six what is one in six called 4hn and say is related what's the else is related to and five what are two and five what are they nation's end Hellfire and then what else is related so now when you go home you're going to enjoy reciting salat sides and going to find those sections yourself it's going to be so much fun barakallahu walikum salam ala carte
